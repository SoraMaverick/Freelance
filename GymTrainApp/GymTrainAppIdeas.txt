GymTrainApp: Priority Breakdown
Phase 0: Groundwork (Essential & Immediate)
This is the absolute baseline.

P1: Core Data Models: Define the structure of your main data entities.

  TrainingDay: (ID, Name, List of Exercise IDs)

  Exercise: (ID, Name, History list)

  HistoryEntry: (ID, Date, Sets, Reps, Weight)

  User Profile: (ID, Name, Current XP, Current Level, Skill Points, perhaps a basic array for "unlocked abilities/badges").

Phase 1: Core Functionality + Profile & Basic Gamification (Alpha/MVP)
  This phase gets your most critical features working and allows for initial testing of the unique gamification loop.

P1: Gym Days Management (CRUD):

  Create/Edit/Delete Gym Days: Users can add, name, and remove their workout routines.

  Add/Remove Exercises to/from Gym Day: Link exercises to specific Gym Days.

  Basic display of Gym Days on the main screen.

  P1: Exercise Management (CRUD):

  Create/Edit/Delete Exercises: Users can define custom exercises.

  Basic Exercise Library (maybe a few pre-filled common exercises to start).

  P1: Workout Session (Basic):

  Start/End Workout: Simple flow to begin and finish a workout session for a chosen Gym Day.

  Logging History Entries: For each exercise during a session, log Sets, Reps, and Weight.

  Basic rest timer functionality.

P1: Training History View:

  List all past workouts.

  View details of a specific past workout (exercises, sets/reps/weight logged).

  Ability to edit/delete individual history entries.

  P1: User Profile & Core Gamification System:

  User Profile Screen: Display current level, XP, and perhaps skill points.

  XP Calculation Logic: Basic mechanism to award XP:

  Upon completing a workout.

  Upon logging new history entries.

  Level Up Logic: When XP reaches a threshold, increment level and reset XP, award skill points.

  Skill Point Allocation (Basic): Simple screen to "spend" skill points (even if it just increments a counter for now, or logs which "skill" was chosen). No complex effects yet.

Phase 2: Enhancements & Deeper Gamification (Beta Ready)
Building on the core, making the app more engaging and useful.

P2: Advanced Gamification:

Quests System (Basic):

Define a few simple quests (e.g., "Complete 3 workouts this week").

Mechanism to track quest progress and award XP/rewards upon completion.

Display active/completed quests on a dedicated screen or profile.

Skill Tree UI/Logic (Initial): Visually represent the skill tree and allow users to invest points into specific "skills" (Strength, Endurance, Consistency).

Badges/Achievements (Basic): Award simple badges for milestones (e.g., "First Workout!", "5 Workouts Completed").

P2: Statistics & Progression:

Individual Exercise Progression Charts: Display graphs for weight/reps over time for specific exercises within the history.

Personal Bests (PB) Tracking: Automatically detect and highlight new PBs.

Overall Progress Metrics: Display total volume lifted, total workouts, longest streak.

P2: UI/UX polish:

Refined navigation and transitions.

Improved input forms for exercises/history.

Refined dark mode theming.

Phase 3: Social & Advanced Features (Polished Release / Continuous Improvement)
These are great for long-term engagement but can come after the core is solid.

P3: Friends & Social Features:

User authentication (if not already implemented for profile).

Friend system (add/remove friends).

Basic leaderboards (XP, total workouts).

Activity feed.

P3: Advanced Workout Features:

1RM calculator.

Custom rest timers per exercise.

Supersets/Dropsets planning.

P3: More Complex Quests/Events: Time-limited events, community challenges.

P3: Light Mode Implementation.

P3: Workout Templates / Community Sharing.
