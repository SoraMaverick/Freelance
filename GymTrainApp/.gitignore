# For EAS Build (if you're using it)
# If you are explicitly managing native code (e.g., after `npx expo prebuild`),
# you might need to commit `ios/` and `android/`
# but generally for managed workflow, you can ignore them.
# For typical Expo managed workflow, keeping ios/ and android/ ignored is fine
# as they are generated by Expo when needed for native builds (e.g., EAS Build).

# You might have other temporary or generated files that you want to ignore.
# Add them here based on your project's specific needs.
